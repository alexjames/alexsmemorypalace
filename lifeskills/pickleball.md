## Basic shots
 * The serve - overhand or after one bounce
 * The return - after one bounce
 * 3rd shot - can be a drive or drop
 * Dink - hitting the ball in the kitchen
 * Donk - when you return the ball too high giving the opponent an opportunity to smash
 * Speedup - changing the pace of the ball by hitting it hard after dinking
 * Net cord - when the ball grazes on the net but still goes over the net

## Strategy
 * Aim for your opponents legs, making it harder for them to return.
 * A third shot dink gives you enough time to run up to the net.
 * You want to be as close to the kitchen as possible, giving your opponents lesser room.
