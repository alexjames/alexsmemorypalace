## Basic shots
 * The serve - overhand or after one bounce
 * The return - after one bounce
 * 3rd shot - can be a drive or drop
 * Dink - hitting the ball in the kitchen
 * Donk - when you return the ball too high giving the opponent an opportunity to smash
 * Speedup - changing the pace of the ball by hitting it hard after dinking
 * Net cord - when the ball grazes on the net but still goes over the net
 * Let serve - when the serve hits the net on the way in, is legal as long as its in the box
 * Drop volley - when the opponent drives the ball and you counter with a drop shot
 * Bangers - player who hits with pace

## Grips
 * Bevel 2: Continental grip - good for backhand, weak forehand; used at the kitchen for dinks, volleys and drives
 * Bevel 3: Eastern grip - neutral on both sides; for serves and smashes
 * Bevel 4: Semi-western - great for top-spin, weak backhand

## Strategy
 * Aim for your opponents feet, making it harder for them to return. Between the feet and shins, aim for the shin because it's a harder shot to return.
 * A third shot dink gives you enough time to run up to the net.
 * You want to be as close to the kitchen as possible, giving your opponents lesser room.
 * Imagine there is a thread connecting you and the ball. It pull you as the ball moves. That helps you understand what your optimal position should be.
 * Control and consistency are key elements to the game.
 * Hit high percentage shots.
 * A drink down the line is a little harder because the net is higher there.
