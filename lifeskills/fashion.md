## Principles of Fashion
 * Fit is more important than style. You must know the rules before you bend or break them.
 * Neutral colors never go out of style - cream, beige, black, brown, white, gray

## Materials
#### Polyester
#### Cotton
#### Linen
#### Wool
#### Cashmere

## Principles of Fit
### Polo Shirts
Shirts with longer backsides are meant to be tucked-in (the extra fabric ensures the shirt doesn't come "out" when you bend forwards).
1. Shoulder seam should rest on shoulder bone
2. Collar should only be able to fit too fingers comfortably when the top button is fastened. Otherwise it's too tight or too loose.
3. Sleeve should end mid-bicep and hug your arms as closely as possible. Shorter is feminine and longer makes arms looks small. Baggy sleeves make arms look puny.
4. Shirt should hug chest and taper downwards and not have excess of two inches extra fabric.
5. Length should end between upper and mid crotch.

### Jeans/Pants
Generally get slim fit or tapered fit. Wider fits are *less* stylish.
1. Top should be one or two inches below belly button
2. Should hold without a belt, can fit two fingers in between waist and pant
3. A well-fitting pait of jeans highlight your body. It should hug butt and not have excess fabric 
4. One to two inches extra fabric when pulled from thigh, should closely hug thigh
5. Should taper downards towards the calf 
6. The length should touch top of shoe. Not longer or shorter.
