### Paul Graham
 * Start small working on something that interests you and grow it over time.
 * Do not make a direct frontal attack on big problems. Investors will keep asking "are we there yet?".
 * Big ideas take longer and you have to project longer into the future. And the further out you project, the more likely it is that you'll be wrong.
 * A popular model is that of the "visionary" where you find a specific point in the future and chart a path towards it. A better model is to be like Columbus - "there's something to the west, I'll sail westward". Start with something small that works and when the opportunity comes to move, move westward. Emperically it's better to have a blurry vision than a precise one.

### Alex Karp
 * You have to be 10x better than the people around you to be really successful. Your product needs to be 10x better.
