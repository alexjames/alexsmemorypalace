###### Brian Chesky (Co-founder of AirBnb)
 * Do things that don't scale. Figure out the most perfect experience someone can have. Then figure out how to scale it to a million users.
 * Designing a perfect experience and scaling an experience are different skillsets that use different parts of the brain.

###### Mark Cuban
 * Great founders have hunger, speed and humility.
