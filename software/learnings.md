###### Refactor
 * Make small, manageable changes.
 * Good refactor uses language idiomatic constructs without significantly changing style.
 * If you can't maintain style in the whole codebase, at least maintain it in a single file or module.
 * Deeply understand the code before re-factoring.
 * Avoid adding new libraries and dependencies.
 * Get feedback (code reviews).
