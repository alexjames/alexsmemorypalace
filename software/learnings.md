###### Code
 * Every line of code is a liability.
 * The best code is no code.

###### Refactor
 * Make small, manageable changes.
 * Good refactor uses language idiomatic constructs without significantly changing style.
 * If you can't maintain style in the whole codebase, at least maintain it in a single file or module.
 * Deeply understand the code before re-factoring.
 * Avoid adding new libraries and dependencies.
 * Write tests to ensure functionality doesn't break.
 * Get feedback (code reviews).

###### SRE
 * Hope is not a strategy.
