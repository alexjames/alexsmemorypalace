###### Investment Fundamentals
 * PSA grading is the most accepted form of grading for Pokemon cards for historic reasons. CGC and BCG grading isn't as high in demand.
 * Collectors will always gravitate towards GEM MINT PSA 10 slabs. Those are however really expensive and generally less liquid.
 * PSA 9 MINT slabs are significantly lower priced than PSA 10 and more liquid.
 * You generally want Pokemon cards at leasat PSA >= 8 for vintage and PSA 9/10 for modern cards
