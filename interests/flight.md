##### FAQ
###### How high can an airline fly?
 * Each aircraft has a maximum altitude (service ceiling) at which is it rated to fly. Typically it's 42,000 feet.
 * At higher altitudes, the air is thinner which produces less resistance allowing them to fly faster with less fuel.
 * There are some tradeoffs. At higher altitudes, you have jet stream winds which you have to adjust height to control.
 * If you fly too high, the air may get too thin and cause engines to not produce enough thrust and wings can't produce enough lift.
 * If the cabin de-pressurizes at a high altitude, the plane needs to descend down to a lower altitude. The TUC is the time of useful consciousness i.e how long
